AND RIPE RED FRUIT.

          She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The
          further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
          become.


          She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.



                                 CAT
                    And what do you think you're doing?


          The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.



                                 CORALINE
                    Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what
                    I'M doing.


          The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become

          WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.



                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the
                    old well be here?


          The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
          way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.



                                 CAT
                    Nothing out here ... it's the empty part
                    of this world. She only made what she
                    knew would impress you.



                                 CORALINE
                    But why? Why does she want me?


          They walk over the horizon.


                                 CAT (cont'd)
                    She wants something to love...
