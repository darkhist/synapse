## HELLO :-)

This blog is officially live so maybe now is a good time to talk about what it is and how it works

This is a digital playground built by Quinn Salas [@darkhist](https://github.com/darkhist) :-)

This is my space for:

- thoughts ‚Äì _potentially unfinished_
- inspo
- photography
- music
- code snippets
- side projects ‚Äì _more stuff coming soon_
- and other stuff probably

## WHY

I love having an idea, typing some stuff, and watching it come to life on my computer

There is almost no better feeling <span role="img" aria-label="heart on fire">‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</span>

## HOW

Using 40 lines of JavaScript, I created a program that can be started by running `yarn new` which does the following:

1. Starts a [CLI (Command-Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) that prompts me to type a title for a new blog post
2. Asks me what I'm thinking about and opens a temporary file whhere I can type whatever I want
3. Creates a new [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file with the title, date, and time as metadata ‚Äì along with the contents of the temp file from before (which is actually what you're reading right now)

I can preview changes by running `yarn dev`, and publishing is as easy as committing my changes and running `git push origin main`

After I got an inital prototype working, I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a few libraries to render the pages and handle routing, styled everything with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), then deployed the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

If you're interested, you can [check out the source code here](https://github.com/darkhist/synapse)

## FUTURE

I'll be adding some more features including private posts & tags soon, and I'm really excited to see how this project evolves

Thanks for stopping by :-)
