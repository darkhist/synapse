## WHAT

This blog is officially live so maybe now is a good time to talk about what it is and how it works

Basically, this is a digital playground built by Quinn Salas [@darkhist](https://github.com/darkhist) :-)

This is my space for:

- random thoughts
- inspo
- photos
- art
- music & mixes
- code snippets and technology blurbs
- side projects (more stuff coming soon)
- and other stuff probably

## WHY

I love having an idea, typing some stuff, and watching it come to life on my computer

There is almost no better feeling ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

## HOW

Using 40 lines of JavaScript, I was able to create a program that can be invoked by running `yarn new` which does the following:

1. Starts a [CLI (Command-Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) that prompts me to enter a title for a new post
2. Asks me what I'm thinking about and opens a temporary file in a code editor where I can type whatever I want
3. After saving and closing that file, the program automatically creates a new [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file with the title, date, and time as metadata ‚Äì along with the contents of the temp file (which is actually what you're reading right now)

I can preview changes by running `yarn dev` (or `yarn start` for a production preview) ‚Äì and publishing is as easy as committing my changes and running `git push origin main` to deploy directly to production üòé

After I got an inital prototype working, I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a few libraries to render the pages and handle routing, styled everything with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), then deployed the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

If you're interested, you can [check out the source code here](https://github.com/darkhist/synapse)

## FUTURE

I'll be adding some more features including private posts & tags soon, and I'm really excited to see how this project evolves

For now, I'll be posting lots of music, photos, and other cool stuff so don't touch that dial

Thanks for stopping by :-)
