Hello and good morning :~)

I'm back with some of my favorite unreleased Flume tracks

[Flume – Gotta Let Em Go](https://youtu.be/OQnc0y8xSBk)  
[Flume – Ghost feat. Beyoncé](https://youtu.be/n723j9gl0TY)  
[Flume – Yeah Man](https://youtu.be/mqjA3i4mW9k)  
[Flume – ID](https://youtu.be/SwIOlWmfnDA)

_Gotta Let Em Go eventually became [Depth Charge](https://youtu.be/ntUbHKenZpI) – but I love the unreleased version with the pitched-down vocals_

_Yeah Man eventually became [Weekend feat. Moses Sumney](https://youtu.be/DT9BrbtKdTM)_

_– and, unfortunately, the other tracks are still unreleased :~(_

These gems originally appeared in [Flume's Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1](https://youtu.be/6DHiYD3BCGY) back in 2015, but it's still one of my favorite mixes of all time so you should totally go check it out

I hope you enjoy some new sounds – thanks for stopping by :~)
